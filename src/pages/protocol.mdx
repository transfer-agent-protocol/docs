Our smart contracts are designed to be flexible, modular, and easy to use. You can interact with them directly or via an API.

We provide a standard for the creation and management of cap tables for tokenized assets. The protocol is designed to be modular and upgradable. We support creation of new cap table implementations and the ability to upgrade existing cap tables.

To understand the protocol, you should start with the [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/tap-ocf) and then move on to the [Onchain Cap Table](/protocol/tap-cap-table).
