# Initial setup

Our `.env.example` files are setup for local development with Docker and Foundry. You'll need to copy them to a new `.env` and update the values with your own. You have to do this twice in the root of the project and inside of the `/chain` folder.

While developing, you'll run Anvil in one terminal window, and the server in another. You'll also need to run Docker in the root folder.

## Setup the server in the root folder

<Steps>

### 1. Setup your environment

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` in the root folder

```bash
cd tap-cap-table && cp .env.example .env
```

You'll also need to setup your `.env.test.local` file for testing. This will be used by the test suite to run tests. 

```bash
cp .env .env.test.local
```

### 2. Update the values

We provide initial defaults for connecting to the database and running Docker. You can get your `PRIVATE_KEY` values from Anvil in a second. You can also use your own (be careful not to use your mainnet keys!)

````md filename=".env"
# Offchain db connection string for mongodb
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://tap:tap@localhost:27017/mongo?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
DATABASE_OVERRIDE=""  # use a database other than the default in DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_REPLSET="0"  # set to "1" if using --replSet option in mongo. this allows transactions

# RPC url for testnet (defaults to Anvil's http://127.0.0.1:8545)
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545

# Change this to the chain id of the network you are deploying to
# Use 31337 for Anvil's, 32586980208 for Arbitrum's
CHAIN_ID=31337

# Update with the private key of the account that will be used to deploy the contracts
PRIVATE_KEY=UPDATE_ME

# Etherscan API keys
ETHERSCAN_L2_API_KEY=UPDATE_ME
ETHERSCAN_L1_API_KEY=UPDATE_ME

# Server port
PORT=8081
````

### 3. Start Docker

Start Docker in the root folder

```bash
docker compose up
```

</Steps>

## Setup Anvil in the `/chain` folder

This repo is onchain first. We use Anvil to run the local blockchain and deploy our cap table smart contracts there. At all times, you should have Anvil running alongside Docker and nodemon. With the mongo DB running on Docker you can start Anvil.

<Steps>

### 1. Setup Forge and Anvil in the `/chain` folder

Install dependencies and setup Foundry and Forge with our setup script:

```bash
yarn install && yarn setup
```

### 2. Start Anvil

This will also give you the private key you need to update in your `.env` file.

```bash
anvil
```
