# Initial setup

Our `.env.example` files are setup for local development with Docker and Foundry. You'll need to copy them to a new `.env` and update the values with your own. You have to do this twice in the root of the project and inside of the `/chain` folder.

<Steps>

### 1. In the root folder

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` in the root folder

```bash
cd tap-cap-table && cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. In the chain folder

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` in the `chain` folder

```bash
cd chain && cp .env.example .env
```

</Steps>
