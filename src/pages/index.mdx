# Transfer Agent Protocol

Transfer Agent Protocol is based on the [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/ocf) and extends it with smart contracts to enable onchain cap table management.

<Callout emoji="⏳">This documentation is currently in public preview</Callout>

## Protocol Specification

The protocol has three major components.

- [Smart contracts](/protocol/tap-cap-table) that enable onchain cap table management. These create transactions onchain, creating a system that allows for primary ownership records to be stored onchain first, then synced to an offchain database.

- [Offchain database](/protocol/tap-ocf) that stores the cap table data. We're currently using a MongoDB that stores cap table data in the [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/tap-ocf).

- [Server](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/tree/main/src/routes) that interacts with both the smart contracts and the offchain database. This server is responsible for syncing the data between the two.
