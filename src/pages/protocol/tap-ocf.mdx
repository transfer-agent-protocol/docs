# Open Cap Table Format

The Open Cap Table Format ([OCF](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-ocf)) is a JSON-based open-source standard for storing and sharing cap table data. We use OCF to store data off chain. The format is maintained by the [Open Cap Table Coalition](https://www.opencaptablecoalition.com/).

## Our Database

Using the OCF, we've created a [database](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/tree/main/src/db) schema with a Mongo implementation. This schema is used by the Transfer Agent Protocol to store and share cap table data off chain.
