# Open Cap Table Format

The Open Cap Table Format ([OCF](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-ocf)) is a standard for storing and sharing cap table data. It is a JSON-based format that is easy to read and write, and is designed to be easily extensible. The OCF is used by the Transfer Agent Protocol to store and share cap table data off chain.

The format was created by the Long Term Stock Exchange ([LTSE](https://ltse.com/)) and is maintained by the [Open Cap Table Coalition](https://www.opencaptablecoalition.com/).

## Our Database

Using the OCF, we've created a [database](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/tree/main/src/db) schema with a Mongo implementation. This schema is used by the Transfer Agent Protocol to store and share cap table data off chain.
